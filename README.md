# HealthKMP

Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile wrapper for HealthKit on iOS and ~~Google Fit and~~ Health Connect on Android.

> Google Fitness API is being deprecated and Health Connect the plugin will transition into the API as the Health Connect

The library supports:
- handling permissions to access health data using the `isAvailable`, `isAuthorized`, `requestAuthorization`, `revokeAuthorization` methods.

Note that for Android, the target phone **needs** to have ~~[Google Fit](https://www.google.com/fit/) or~~ [Health Connect](https://health.google/health-connect-android/) (which is currently in beta) installed and have access to the internet, otherwise this library will not work.

# Using

You need an access token to install GitHub packages, see [Managing your personal access tokens](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens).

local.properties
```
GITHUB_USERNAME=email@email.com
GITHUB_TOKEN=xxx
```

settings.gradle.kts:
```kotlin
dependencyResolutionManagement {
    repositories {
        maven {
            url = uri("https://maven.pkg.github.com/vitoksmile/HealthKMP")
            name = "GitHubPackages"
            credentials {
                val properties = java.util.Properties()
                properties.load(file("local.properties").inputStream())
                username = properties["GITHUB_USERNAME"].toString()
                password = properties["GITHUB_TOKEN"].toString()
            }
        }
    }
}
```

build.gradle:
```kotlin
sourceSets {
    val commonMain by getting {
        dependencies {
            implementation("com.vitoksmile.health-kmp:core:0.0.1")
        }
    }
}
```

If you are using Koin, add to build.gradle:
```kotlin
implementation("com.vitoksmile.health-kmp:koin:0.0.1")
```
